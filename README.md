### Files needed:
- Hive.cs
- yourjavascript.jslib


In short the Hive.cs script is able to talk with the jslib code in unity so that you can connect and send transaction over hive.

You will need to code you custom action sin yourjavascript.jslib then call them using Hive.cs in your project which will allow you to use the Hive Keychain in your project!
